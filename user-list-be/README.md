# Backend Node.js Application

This is a simple backend application build using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides an API to manage user information and also integrates Swagger UI for API documentation. The application can be used to fetch the user data stored in the MongoDB database and also includes a seeding functionality to populate some initial data.

## Features

- **User Management API**: Allows to fetch list of users.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Provides an interactive UI for API documentation.
